<h3 id="breakingchange-shsremoved">Breaking Change - SHS Removed</h3>

<p>Support for SHS (&#8220;Secure HandShake&#8221;) has been removed completely, as this feature is not supported properly with TLS 1.3
and most current web browsers. Please check the migration guide for information about how to update or replace
existing login models that made use of this feature.</p>

<h3 id="breakingchange-elcardremoved">Breaking Change - ELCARD Removed</h3>

<p>Removed support for the obsolete, proprietary ELCARD adapter authentication system as the ELCARD authentication system
has been end-of-life for several years. As of today, any installation using it should switch to either OpenID Connect or
SAML. There is not specific migration path other than that.</p>

<h3 id="variousimprovementsandfixes">Various Improvements and Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>The OIDC OP no longer redirects to the <code>redirect_uri</code> in case of an unknown
 or missing <code>client_id</code> in the authentication request, in order to prevent
 attacks that would redirect via the trusted OP domain to an &#8220;evil&#8221; domain.
 (5.19.0.4)</li>
<li>If <code>http.ssl.accepted.cns</code> is set to a list of CNs in the HTTP Adapter
 (or <code>http.ssl.accepted.cns</code> in the WS Adapter), previous behavior was to only
 check if the certificate CN is part of this list. Now the check is also OK
 if any of the SANs (Subject Alternate Names) is in the list of accepted CNs.
 (This reflects the fact that if <code>http.ssl.enforce.host=true</code> the hostname
 is allowed if it matches the cert CN or any of the cert SANs.) (5.19.0.0)</li>
<li>Supporting non-http(s) URL schemes for <code>do.redirect</code> and <code>do.logout</code> in the case
 where the <code>url.absolute.allow</code> model parameter is set to <code>true</code>,
 e.g. URL <code>myscheme99://somehost.net/...</code> (5.19.0.0)</li>
<li>Fixed rare concurrency issue in <code>crypto.base32encode</code> and <code>crypto.base32decode</code>
 script functions. (5.19.0.0)</li>
<li>Fixed rare issue with setting a cookie in the response manually using the <code>response.setHeader()</code> function
 disabling the &#8216;SLSPrefs&#8217; cookie. (5.19.0.0)</li>
</ul>
